Used the dynamic textarea from 
https://www.codingnepalweb.com/auto-resize-textarea-html-css-javascript/

Features:
- Write data
- Push to dataBase
- Shows the data in the exact same time
- lets you edit your data and save in parallel to the data dataBase
- Lets you delete your data too
- dynamic textarea: expands as the number of line grows

Future Features:
- alert box before deletion (DONE)
- Update of time as we edited the thing (controversial feature: as we may only fix some spell error and even then I change the entire time thing)
- Add a tag of edited after we have edited it (DONE)
- Color changing modes

Potential Bugs and Issues
- readData() on line 70: too exposed and open and runs on every js reload 
- i want to remove the ogTime variable to make the database less cluttured and instead use the Time property to do it (FIXED IN ATMP 11)
- Edited sign gets removed on reload (FIXED in ATMP 10)
- The footer is not at all optimized for a growing screen
