A blogging Site which updates and stores your data

- My Experience
  - 
  - I used Raw HTML CSS and JS the main magic comes when I learned and integrated Firebase in my app for the first time on my own which lead to many problems and its probably my first initial attempts to actually get out of tutorial hell
  - I know its not a flashy site but I like simple sites This project also helped my understand the basics of the Firebase how to integrate Firebase Database and use its functionalities for Read data and project it 
  - I also learned to write more cleaner code
  - learned on how to work with the AI which helped me in the dynamic textarea and sorting the data part too 
  - I heavily learned on how to chain different things which i got from other functions too 
  - Provided me with a lot of potential errors and bugs for me to fix
  - Gave me a taste about media queries which lead to a more responsive design 


- Features I Provide
  - 
  - Dynamic TextArea which expands as u break or add lines
  - Submitting it directly adds to the firebase databse 
  - parallely updates the frontend with the reliable data too 
  - You can edit your thoughts which will directly apply to your frontend and to your database too at the same time 
  - Delete button also deleted your thoguhts from the entire database
