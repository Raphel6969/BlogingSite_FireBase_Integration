# BlogingSite_FireBase_Integration


A blogging Site which updates and stores your data

- My Experience
  - 
  - I used Raw HTML CSS and JS the main magic comes when I learned and integrated Firebase in my app for the first time on my own which lead to many problems and its probably my first initial attempts to actually get out of tutorial hell
  - I know its not a flashy site but I like simple sites This project also helped my understand the basics of the Firebase how to integrate Firebase Database and use its functionalities for Read data and project it 
  - I also learned to write more cleaner code
